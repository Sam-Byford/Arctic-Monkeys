        <p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
        <p>The task for this project was to create an immersive interactive website for a band or brand to facilitate their online profile. A unique selling point (USP) of the website was also needed. This would come in the form of a ‘customizer’. The band chosen for the website was the Arctic Monkeys. The latest web standards and specifications had to be considered when creating this website therefore it was developed with the use of the most recent mark-up available. HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to add the interactive element.
            The biggest challenge that had to be faced was how to implement and correctly use local storage along with the customizer. This was how the USP was developed. The storage was manipulated with the use of JavaScript and jQuery to allow the user to create and store their own unique album. Songs were selected with checkboxes and it took a long time to figure out how to get the value of this checkbox, put it in an array and then in turn store this array in local storage. When done the customizer led to the development of an “immersive and interactive website”. No other official band site has a feature such as this therefore providing my USP
            At an early development stage user feedback was provided to improve what had already developed and what was going to be developed. This feedback proved very useful in the final design of the site and led to the improvement the overall usability of the site.
        </p>

        <p><b><u>Best practices</u></b></p>
        <p>To ensure the site met with best practices and standards I first had to understand the correct way of coding HTML. W3C provided a useful source for this. Instead of using a 'div' tag for each individual section, more semantic mark-up was utilised. Tags such as 'section' and 'header' were used in place of 'div' tags. This made the overall mark-up less confusing to look at, more understandable and made it clearer to see the separate divisions on the page.
        Correct file structure also had to be implemented:

        <p><b><u>Pros and cons of Current web standards</u></b></p>
        <p>Standards have vastly evolved since the beginning of the world wide web, however the W3C (World wide web consortium) defines modern day standards as those which “enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device” (W3C, 2017). This involves the use of HTML5 and technologies such as CSS3. Developing using current web standards ensures the sites will work on all current browsers and legacy browsers meaning the website will work on older platforms as well. This increases the audience that your website will be accessible to and in a business viewpoint increases the image of the band.</p>
        <p>Current web standards enable us to create sites that have increased interoperability meaning they can be used on a wide range of devices and screen sizes equally. This can be seen in the W3C’s standard for “one web” which ensures this cross-device compliance. As of November 2016, the majority of web traffic now occurs through mobile devices. According to The Times, “51.3pc of pages were loaded on mobile devices in October, the first time they have surpassed desktop and laptop computers” (Titcomb, 2016). Only three years prior to this article the percentage stood at 25%. The supporting video shows how interoperability is achieved in the project website.</p>
        <p>As explained earlier HTML5 now allows for increased semantic mark-up. Also, CSS3 now allows greater customisation and control over elements styles. Increased text styles and animations are now directly available in CSS3 without the need for JavaScript or jQuery coding. This makes the process of web development much simpler and more efficient. Increased simplicity then leads to reduced development time and therefore reduced cost (time and or money) on the site owner.</p>
        <p>However, with modern specifications comes less creativity options as the code must validate to these specifications. Previous standards, despite not having the best practices, were not as strict and restraining. When validating the sites HTML files each image required an alt tag to meet accessibility standards. This, while nothing major, added mark-up and complexity that was not needed to many of the images. This highlights that despite the accessibility standards providing fair access to millions of disabled citizens it does cause problems for developers to implement standards successfully. As well as this the property “frameborder” was not allowed to be declared in the HTML 'iframe' tag and instead had to be called in CSS. However, the CSS property was not the same, so some time had to be spent finding out what the correct CSS property was.</p>
        <p>Mark-up and code must also be written to a much stricter set of rules that require increased knowledge. For example, the JavaScript .append() method is used in the customizer to add the chosen songs to the users own album. However Microsoft Edge does not seem to support the .append() method in the same way as Chrome and Firefox. This means the customizer is not available on Edge even though it works perfectly on every other browser. This is down to Edge’s incredibly strict approach to web development standards. Therefore, In order to properly comply with standards .append() should not be used at all as multi browser support does not exist for it.
