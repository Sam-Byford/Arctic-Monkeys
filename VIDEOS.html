            <h3>Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair</h3>
            <p>Released as the first single from their fourth studio album Suck It and See. The music video shows the band performing the song through a 1980s-style video camera with huge amounts of colour, distortion and an old computer showing the word "DON'T". The video then pans out to see Alex Turner sat on the now infamous chair at the centre of the Kenny/Shiells altercation. Other scenes shown by the distorted colour are the band driving a Cadillac in L.A during recording, Alex showing the V sign, Jamie Cook holding a Scythe on the rocks, the band in a black Daimler DS420 and clips of Sheffield Wednesday vs. Manchester United & Arsenal, citing the band's support of Wednesday.</p>

            <p>opening track on their second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare. The song was released as the first single from the album on 2 April 2007. The video features the band playing in a sparse sepia set, interspersed with clips of female dancers in front of a large computerised display, stock footage from old medical educational programs and brief flashes of images of objects mentioned in the lyrics, such as "Brian", "jacuzzi" and lightning in place of "thunder". The video was recorded on 14 February 2007</p>

            <h3>Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?</h3>
            <p>Released as the third single from their fifth studio album on 11 August 2013. The video shows Alex Turner, Jamie Cook, Nick O'Malley and Matt Helders in a pub having a drink. Alex sends multiple text messages to a girl called Stephanie to get a booty call. When he leaves the pub, he walks through the city and hallucinates seeing Stephanie having sex with different men and riding naked on the back of a man's motorcycle. Eventually, he gets to the wrong house and repeatedly knocks on the door while texting her "I'm outside". The camera shows the girl at her home picking up the phone and seeing 17 missed messages from "Alex band guy". She rolls her eyes and decides to ignore his texts.</p>

            <h3>I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor</h3>
            <p>Released through Domino Records as the band's first single from their debut studio album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2005). The video is a live recording of the band playing the song in a studio with a small audience watching with both the video and audio taken live. Alex Turner introduces the band and the song and asks viewers not to "believe the hype" of the song[4]. The video was shot using three Ikegami 3-tube colour television cameras from the 1980s[5] to give it a more aged effect.</p>

            <p>released on 16 January 2006 as the second single from their debut studio album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006). The song's music video was directed by Paul Fraser and premiered on MTV2 on 21 December 2005. It starred Lauren Socha and Stephen Graham. The video used footage from a longer film, Scummy Man, which used the same actors who appeared in the music video to tell the story of 'Nina', the nameless "that girl there" from the song.</p>

            <h3>R U Mine?</h3>
            <p>The music video was first released onto YouTube on 27 February 2012 and features radio DJ and musician Steve Jones debuting the song on his show on American modern rock radio station KROQ-FM while Matt Helders, Alex Turner and Nick O'Malley lip-sync the song in a car. In 2013, the video won the NME Award for Best Video.

                Drummer Matt Helders, who came up with the idea for the video, revealed it was directed by Focus Creeps, who 'gave [the band] a camera and told us to film'</p>
