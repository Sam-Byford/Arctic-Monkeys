# Arctic-Monkeys

For the first-year Web Authoring module, a lecturer asked us to design and develop a completly new, responsive, website based on a brand or a band. I chose to develop my website around the Arctic Monkeys. This decision was made due to the Arctic Monkeys current website being lackluture and having an extremly ugly user interface.

The website was developed over the course of three months using HTML5. The project allowed me to use, and improve, my skills of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
